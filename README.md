ScientificValue
=
An usefull Arduino library which print pretty scientific values

## The library encapsulates two classes:
 - **SciFormat:** this class holds parameters (number of digits, maximum scales, maximal displayed value etc...) that will be used by the SciValue class.
 - **SciValue:** this class knows how to format itself based on the parameters of an SciFormat object. Severals operators have been overloaded in this class.

## More details:
The code is well documented, please take a look at SciValueExample.ino to get a sight on how to use the library. Of course you can mail me, and add an issue or feature request here on GitHub.

Cheers.
